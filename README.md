# Hi, I'm Aryan. ⚡


I am a Computer Science undergraduate focused on **High-Performance Computing**, **Systems Architecture**, and **AI Infrastructure**. I don't just use libraries; I optimize them.

### Key Contributions
- **[NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM):** Authored and merged core unit tests for filesystem utilities. Designed CPU-based verification logic to decouple CI testing from GPU hardware dependencies.
- **Systems Engineering:** Building a custom memory allocator (`malloc`/`free`) from scratch to handle external fragmentation and heap management.

###  The Arsenal
| Domain | Stack |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | C++, Go, Python, Java |
| **Systems** | Linux, Bash, Git, Docker |
| **Interests** | Low Latency Systems, Distributed Computing, OS Architecture |

###  Current Focus
- **Deep Dive:** Operating Systems (Paging, Virtual Memory).
- **Grind:** LeetCode (Arrays, Two Pointers, DP) & System Design.
- **Reading:** *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* (OSTEP).
